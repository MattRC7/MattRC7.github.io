    <p> A senior undergraduatae at Tufts University majoring in Physics and Computer Science. I grew up in the suburbs around Boston, have been rightfully indoctrinated with the mindset of a Boston sports fan since birth, and will be working at athenahealth, Inc. after graduation. </p>

    <p> I enjoy playing both basketball and quidditch (yes you read that correctly). I am also an avid gamer, primarily on Nintendo systems but also PC and Xbox. I am a huge fan of trailer and epic soundtrack music (<a href="http://trailermusicnews.com/">this</a> is my favorite site for finding new music!) I dabble in video game programming in my spare time.</p>
